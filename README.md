The Corpus for Idiolectal Research (CIDRE)

In this corpus, you can find more than 400 fiction works of 11 French authors from the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. 
We dated these works with the date of writing. 

Together with the corpus, we provide 2 scripts in python to collect a corpus of ebooks.
